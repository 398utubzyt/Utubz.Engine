# Utubz.Internal
The internal module. This is where most of the internal engine or native code is found. While there's not much here, there are subdirectories that have more specific purposes.

Things in this directory include:
- `ProcessLoop`: the main loop that the rest of the engine is built upon. It's recommended that you don't mess with this unless there's something significant that needs to be reworked.
